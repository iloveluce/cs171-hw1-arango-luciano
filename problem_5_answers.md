1. Pretty much everything. There are just blank bars. For starters we need to know
what the bar chart is about, and beyond that the units that are being measured and
a scale of some type. A title would be nice too. 

2. 1 - Rect - the bars of the bar graph 
2 - Title - what state
3 - Rate - a numerical value of the rate (we put inside of the bar)

3. Yes, if we implement the text first, then the bar graph will be rendered on top
of the text. This really only affects our rates, which seem to be dimmed out. Possibly
something to do with opacity.
